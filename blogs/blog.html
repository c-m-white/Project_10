        <p>So far in this course, I have learned basic html. I have also started learning the concepts of css, whether it is inline, internal, or external. We have been encouraged to save all of our work, and that has been a valuable resource for me to look back and find examples. I have also been able to research on my own how to do some things, as the course I am currently taking cannot cover every detail. Although I don't enjoy being confused with a difficult task ahead of me, I really enjoy the satisfaction that comes when I have finally figured something out and it just "clicks". I really appreciate that the Zoom classes are recoreded, so I can go back and watch them at my own pace as I pause them and do my own research. The knowledge is coming in slowly, but surely.</p><br><br>

        <h2>8.18.23</h2>
        <p>I am climbing the hill perhaps a bit more slowly than I had originally anticipated.  I am loving learning about CSS, but the whole concept of Bootstrap and SCSS is still difficult for me to comprehend.  I am trying to implement elements that I have learned into the design of this webpage.  </p>

        <p>I am finally learning Javascript!  We will see how this goes! Some days, I am still so confused, then something clicks and I can see the pieces fit together.</p>
