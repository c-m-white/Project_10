        <p>I am a 44 year old mother of four.  In the 24 years that I have been married, I have devoted most of that time at home, raising my children.  A few years ago, I decided to venture out into the workplace and landed a job at an Amazon Sort Center.  I worked for about six months at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/oregon/amazon-fulfillment-center-pdx5-410858465"> PDX5 </a>, just outside of Portland, Oregon, before moving to Phoenix, AZ. After settling in with my family, I once again found employment with Amazon, this time at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/arizona/gyr2-fulfillment-center-459181060">GYR2</a>.</p>
        <p>Outside of working at Amazon (which I do enjoy), I love playing the piano, cheering my kids on in marching band, and playing with muy dogs.  I also enjoy reading, hiking, sleeping, and a good cup of coffee.  I am excited to be learning about software development through <a class="highlight" href ="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation One</a>, offered by<a class="highlight" href="https://www.amazoncareerchoice.com/home">Amazon's Career Choice</a> program.</p>
