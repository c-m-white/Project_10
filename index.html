            <h2>Introduction...</h2> 
            <section>
                <p> Whoever said that you can't teach an old dog new tricks has got it wrong! I am currrently 44 years old, and I am learning software development for the first time in my life. I am excited to take this journey. You can think of this website as if it were a blank slate. As I navigate through my software development class, the information I am absorbing is being painted onto that blank slate. This website will reflect evertything that I am learning in this course. My learning and growth will be documented here. </p>

                <p> As mentioned above, this website will document my adventures in what I learn about software development. Specifically, I have been learning about web design with html. Currently, I work overnight in an Amazon warehouse. While I really do enjoy my job, I do not want to be doing that for the rest of my life. With a little bit of encouragement from my family, I have decided to take a class that will help broaden my horizons and give me further opportunities in the future.</p><br />
            <p> I have even opened a <a class="highlight" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-white-306b6429/">LinkedIn</a> profile for the first time. I am excited to gain experience and to build up my portfolio. This website is a great place to start!Even though there is currently nothing in my LinkedIn profile, I do acknowledge that everyone has to start somewhere. This is my beginning!</p>

                <p>8/4/23__
                    So far in this course, I have learned basic html. I have also started learning the concepts of css, whether it is inline, internal, or external. We have been encouraged to save all of our work, and that has been a valuable resource for me to look back and find examples. I have also been able to research on my own how to do some things, as the course I am currently taking cannot cover every detail. Although I don't enjoy being confused with a difficult task ahead of me, I really enjoy the satisfaction that comes when I have finally figured something out and it just "clicks". I really appreciate that the Zoom classes are recoreded, so I can go back and watch them at my own pace as I pause them and do my own research. The knowledge is coming in slowly, but surely.</p>
                  <p>8/18/23__ I am climbing the hill perhaps a bit more slowly than I had originally anticipated.  I am loving learning about CSS, but the whole concept of Bootstrap and SCSS is still difficult for me to comprehend.  I am trying to implement elements that I have learned into the design of this webpage.  </p>
